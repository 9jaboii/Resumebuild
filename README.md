# Resumebuild
#initial project description

This project is a continuous process, the goal is to constantly add new services to make the project better. It is a resume website built using simple HTML, CSS and Javascript. It is hosted AWS using S3, CloudFront, and route53. I am going to add a database also using AWS to implement a visitor count on the webpage. I am also going to streamline the process by automating some of the processes using Lambda, AWS CodePipeLine etc. I will make regular changes to this readme file outlining the changes made to the implementation.
